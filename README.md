It would be useful to come back and watch these multiple times as you continue through these sections.

# Front-end development
If you watched the videos above, then you probably can see that there are lot of moving parts. Where do we start? It's going to be the most rewarding to start on the front end building things you can see. This begins with a foundation of HTML/CSS/JS. From there, we'll acquaint ourselves with some modern front-end frameworks.

## HTML/CSS Basics
- HTML - https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
- CSS - https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

## Coding basics
- Learn the basics of javascript with one of these resources (the first two are the most approachable, the third link is more comprehensive):
 - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript
 - https://www.learn-js.org/
 - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_html.asp

If you're not familiar wtih variables, arrays, if statements, loops, and objects, then learning this skill will be uncomfortable.
The good news is that most every language you'll see from this point on uses these same ideas, so you'll be in good shape once you get the hang of it.
Take your time, and after you find youself doing this over and over again, these concepts will be close at hand. It will eventually become second nature.

## Javascript projects
- How do you get better? Build stuff, do little projects. Do one a day for 30 days. https://javascript30.com/

*(sidebar, this would be a good time to create an account in github and start keeping track of your coding projects - I can help you on this)*

The course is free, and I used it when I was starting this stuff. You don't have to do all 30 projects, especially the ones that use webcams or other fancy stuff. The guy has a bit of a squeaky voice, but the content is good, and all of the answers are available if you get stuck. In a single day, you may only need to spend an hour or so. The goal of this section is to give you a strong enough foundation in javascript that you can be dangerous with it.

## Front-end frameworks
Building websites with plain-old (i.e. Vanilla) javascript can lead to a lot of trouble and headaches when building larger web apps. The trend has been to use these things called 'frameworks' which handle a lot of the lower level details and allow you to manage things in larger pieces. People say React is not a framework, it's a library. It doesn't really matter what you call it, it helps you build frontend web apps pretty well. 

At this point, if you learn React, you have a very strong front-end foundation you can use to build whatever front-end app you need to. The world has invested heavily in React, so it's not going anywhere.

- There are a lot of front-end frameworks out there...React (created by facebook) is probably the most popular - https://reactjs.org/
- Read through the documentation for ReactJS and maybe even play around with the Todo app they use as an example.
- Pick a starter project to build in React (also using 'Redux' as well)
  - Build a full app in React https://medium.com/webdevils-advocate/react-redux-react-router-and-rainy-day-fund-tutorial-e589f0803306
  - This is dated, but it's what I built for the first time. It's a bit ambitious since it also has a backend that uses something called websockets, which is an entirely new concept and might not make much sense: https://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html
  - If neither of these two things interest you, then find your own tutorial - just make sure it also includes Redux. I can also find a more appropriate project, I just pick the two above based on a quick glance.


# Backend development and databases
We covered a lot of the front-end, but notice that we are missing things like a login page that saves your username and password. We don't have an app that holds on to our data or stores it somewhere. What's missing? At this point, it's a database. There are cases where it makes sense for our front-end code to send requests to a database to store and retrieve data, but that's not always a good idea for something a bit more professional. We need to look at backend stuff.

- (Need a video here to discuss backend servers, etc. This one is ok https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toLnp3PJVVA)
- REST API basics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-BpqyOT3a8

// TODO add more backend stuff here

## Backend Project
// TODO Some discussion about API's and web apps that are served from the backend. Probably want to include stuff on Object Oriented programming

// TODO decide on a backend framework/language that will be useful in the professional world

## SQL vs. NoSQL databases
- A link to a SQL udemy course (you can use my credentials to watch it). It's probably overkill.
- This might be good enough frankly https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
- A youtube video or something regarding NoSQL databases

# Capstone project

A full-stack web application - ideally a front-end that uses React/Redux, a backend for handling API requests for data, and a database that hold everything. Maybe at this point, we pivot to using an object oriented language? Or just use NodeJS since it's going to be the most straightforward. Once this is done, an idea might be to build a mobile app. Get the mobile app deployed to the app store. All of this should be enough to score interviews. Need to decide at this point to use SQL or NoSQL as a DB. Factor in costs, etc. Ideally, want to pay little to nothing to get this thing hosted.

# Interview preparation

This is a whole different beast on its own. The reason why I saved this for last is because it's the least relevant to actually being able to do the job. All of the stuff above will prepare you with a foundation to set you off on a good path. Besides answering questions about 

// TODO include some resources
